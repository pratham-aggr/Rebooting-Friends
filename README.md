# Rebooting Friends: A Data-Driven Blueprint for the Ultimate Reboot

Welcome to the **Rebooting Friends** project! 

## Project Overview

Firstly I used **Pandas** to clean and manipulate the dataset, identifying the most experienced directors and writers of *Friends* based on the number of episodes they contributed to. 

- The most experienced directors are **Gary Halvorson** and **Kevin S. Bright**.
- The most experienced writers (story & teleplay) are **Ted Cohen** and **Andrew Reich**.
